# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! I'm still exploring, so be gentle! ðŸ˜Š

Hi, I'm Carolina Neto. I started my data journey in 2023 and I know there is still a long way to go, but we have to start somewhere right!

ðŸ¦– I'm passionate about dinosaurs
Dinosaurs have always fascinated me. I love learning about their history, different species, and imagining what life was like when they roamed the Earth.

ðŸŽµ I can't live without music
Music is a vital part of my life. It inspires me, helps me relax, and fuels my creativity.

ðŸ“š I'm dedicated and always try to learn something new
I believe in continuous learning and self-improvement. Whether it's picking up a new skill, reading a book, or taking a course, I'm always on the lookout for new knowledge.

ðŸš€ I don't like boredom and I always want to innovate
I thrive on creativity and innovation. Routine bores me, so I constantly seek new challenges and opportunities to think outside the box and come up with unique solutions.
